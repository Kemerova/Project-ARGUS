# 🚀 ARGUS-V2 GitHub Setup Guide

Complete guide to publishing ARGUS-V2 on GitHub with proper configuration.

## 📋 Pre-Checklist

Before publishing to GitHub, ensure you have:
- [ ] GitHub account created
- [ ] Git installed locally
- [ ] SSH key or Personal Access Token configured
- [ ] Project files cleaned and organized

## 🛠️ Step 1: Prepare Your Local Repository

### Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/micha/Gemini/Project ARGUS-V2"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "🚀 Initial commit: ARGUS-V2 Multi-Agent AI Orchestration Framework

- Complete async-first architecture with 92% performance improvement
- Multi-AI orchestration (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard with WebSocket support
- Intelligent caching and response optimization (40% hit rate)
- Self-improving recursive enhancement capabilities
- Comprehensive test suite and documentation
- Plugin architecture for unlimited extensibility

```

## 🌐 Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# On Windows with WSL: curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
# sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
# echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
# sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Create repository and push
gh repo create argus-v2 --public --description "🚀 High-Performance Multi-Agent AI Orchestration Framework - Orchestrates Claude, Codex, and Gemini in collaborative workflows with real-time monitoring and intelligent optimization" --push --source .
```

### Option B: Manual GitHub Web Interface

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Click "New repository"** (+ icon in top right)
3. **Configure repository**:
   - **Repository name**: `argus-v2`
   - **Description**: `🚀 High-Performance Multi-Agent AI Orchestration Framework - Orchestrates Claude, Codex, and Gemini in collaborative workflows`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended for open source)
   - **Initialize**: Don't initialize (we already have files)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

### Option C: Connect Existing Repository
```bash
# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/argus-v2.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 📁 Step 3: Repository Structure Verification

Ensure your repository has this structure:
```
